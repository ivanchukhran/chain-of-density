The 33-year-old was dismissed by referee Craig Pawson following a clash with Villa defender Alan Hutton in the Foxes' 2-1 defeat at Villa Park. A Football Association statement read: 'Leicester City's Paul Konchesky, who was dismissed for violent conduct in the game against Aston Villa on December 7, 2014 will not serve a suspension after a claim of wrongful dismissal was upheld following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today.' Paul Konchesky was shown a red card by referee Craig Pawson during Leicester's defeat by Aston Villa . The Football Association have revealed Konchesky will not serve a ban following the incident at Villa Park . Konchesky made a late challenge on Alan Hutton before clashing with the Scottish international . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson appeared reluctant to appeal against the sending-off when he spoke about it in Sunday's post-match press conference. 'It's difficult to have a decision like that rescinded in all honesty,' he said. 'I think it would lack a bit of class for me to ask for retrospective action against another manager's player. 'When moments pass you by in games officials are there to do a job, to do it as best they can. 'I can understand because of how it looked - it was because he was pushed away and they kept in contact. In the initial contact I don't think Paul was the instigator. 'It's easy to be over critical. I don't want to get into a debate about getting other players sent off.' However, the club took the decision to contest the three-match ban and it has now been successfully overturned, leaving Konchesky free to play, starting against Manchester City on Saturday. Hutton and Konchesky went head-to-head before the Leicester defender was sent off with 10 minutes to go . The duo were involved in a second-half scuffle during Aston Villa 2-1 victory against Leicester . Hutton received a yellow card for the part he played in the incident with Konchesky .

Watching brief: Paul Scholes (left) was on the touchline on Tuesday as Salford City took on Stalybridge Celtic, the team he co-owns, in pre-season friendly . Many people thought Scholes had burned his bridges with the club over the summer, though, after criticising some United players in a World Cup column he wrote for a betting company. Scholes questioned whether Wayne Rooney was already past his best at 28 and why the club had spent \u00a330million on defender Luke Shaw. It is understood, though, that current manager Louis van Gaal and chief executive Ed Woodward still believe the former England star still has something to offer and that Scholes has been told that the club would be happy to talk. Scholes will not be offered a job with the first team coaching pool as Van Gaal is now happy with this immediate staff. Helping out: Scholes was part of Ryan Giggs' coaching set-up at the end of last season .

        "article": "(Mental Floss) -- If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page. For starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor. 1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan . In the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further. It was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration. In the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets. But when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them. Struggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role. In a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets. By revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them. Mental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship . 2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough . In 1966, Danish engineer Karl Kr\u00f8yer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Kr\u00f8yer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years. Indeed, Kr\u00f8yer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess. So in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, \"If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!\" Although it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story. The final paragraph read, \"Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago.\" A footnote revealed that \"literature\" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist. Mental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street . But why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures. Gaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research? 3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail . In a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan. Inspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial. In 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration. Today, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too. Mental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman) 4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day . Like most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers. During his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as \"America's most famous boy hero.\" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead. Sound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century. But that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia. Of course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland. Plus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as \"the greatest modern-day philosopher.\" For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

        "article": "Iraqi troops, security forces and tanks surged into Baghdad on Sunday as political turmoil deepened over who should lead the country. Military tanks were deployed to several neighborhoods in central Baghdad, two Iraqi police officials told CNN. The officials said there are also significantly more troops in Baghdad's Green Zone, the secure area where many government buildings, the military headquarters and the U.S. Embassy are located. The stepped-up troop presence comes as Iraqi forces battle Islamist militants in northern Iraq, and just after Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused Fuad Masum, Iraq's newly elected President, of violating the country's constitution by extending the deadline for Iraq's biggest political coalitions to nominate a candidate for prime minister. The precise reason for the growing number of troops in the Iraqi capital was unclear. But CNN military analyst retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona described it as an \"ominous\" development that signals the Iraqi Prime Minister doesn't want to hand over power. \"You've got Nuri al-Maliki refusing to step down. Now he's mobilized not just security troops loyal to him, but now he's mobilized army units to put tanks in the streets. Some of the bridges have been closed,\" Francona said. \"It looks like he's trying to lock down the city in some sort of confrontation with the President, so this does not portend well.\" Retired Marine Gen. James Williams said the stepped up security could also be a response to advances by militants from ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has now declared itself the Islamic State. \"It could be a show of force. If you're talking about protecting government buildings, there may be a sense that ISIS forces may be closer than everybody thinks at this point, and so  depending on what the undercurrent in Baghdad right now, that could be a great sign for concern,\" Williams said. \"But it may also be a concern that there's a coup afoot.\" CNN's Michael Holmes said al-Maliki could be digging in his heels for a political battle. \"It's not in his DNA to go without a fight. This is a man who's really feeling besieged at the moment. He's cornered on all sides, if you like,\" Holmes said. \"He's got ISIS on his doorstep, in a military sense. He even had the Grand Ayatollah the other day saying politicians should not cling to their posts. But this is a guy who seizes onto power. He holds it.\" In a televised speech Sunday, al-Maliki said he would file a complaint against Masum for allegedly violating Iraq's constitution. Lawmakers elected Masum, a veteran Kurdish politician who's been a member of the Iraqi parliament since 2005, to the presidency last month. Choosing a prime minister is a key next step for Iraq's leaders. Critics of al-Maliki have called for him to pull his name out of the running, but he's repeatedly refused. Al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government have been under enormous international pressure to be more inclusive of the country's minority Sunni population, who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process. Obama administration officials have talked repeatedly about how their priority is a political settlement that creates a more inclusive government in Iraq. A deadline to agree on a new prime minister had been set for last week and was extended on Sunday. In a statement Sunday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States is closely monitoring the situation and supports Iraq's President. \"The United States fully supports President Fuad Masum in his role as guarantor of the Iraqi constitution,\" she said. \"We reaffirm our support for a process to select a Prime Minister who can represent the aspirations of the Iraqi people by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner. We reject any effort to achieve outcomes through coercion or manipulation of the constitutional or judicial process.\" U.S. officials who put their faith in al-Maliki for years may have misjudged him, Francona said. \"Most people thought that there would be this peaceful transition to the new government. He served for two terms,\" Francona said. \"Now he's refusing to step down. ... This looks very bad, like he's going to refuse to go.\" Iraq's PM defiantly says he'll stay amid ISIS threat .",

        "article": "By . Sarah Johnson . PUBLISHED: . 15:56 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:50 EST, 30 November 2012 . A motorist died of his injuries after he was punched and kicked by a gang of men in front of his teenage son. Johnny Assani, 43, died of his injuries in hospital after he was left lying bleeding and unconscious in a road in Derby. His 16-year-old son Mukhaila Assani, was also allegedly punched by some of the men when he tried to drag the attackers off his father. Victim: Johnny Assani was kicked and punched by a group of men and died of his injuries in hospital the next day . Giving evidence at Nottingham Crown Court, Mukhaila said: \u2018I was shocked when I saw my dad fall. He didn\u2019t see the man who hit him coming and I think it was a shock to my dad that he\u2019d been hit. He added: \u2018He didn\u2019t get up after that, he never got up again. He tried and tried but he couldn\u2019t because of being kicked and punched while he was laid on the ground. \u2018I tried to pull the men off him but they started to attack me then and punched me in the face. \u2018I was left with a cut lip and bruising to my head as I tried to pull them away from my dad. \u2018When they were hitting me I tried to protect myself and was protecting my face by shielding it with my arms. I had my eyes closed and I couldn\u2019t see what was happening to my dad.\u2019 Seconds later the men dispersed and Mukhaila saw his father lying on the ground, his head on the pavement and his feet on the road, breathing but unconscious and unresponsive. Two brothers, Mohammed Shahid and Mohammed Rafiq have already been convicted of killing Mr Assani. Incident: Police officers and teams of forensics raid a house on Walbrook Road where Mr Assani was attacked . A third brother, Mohammed Tariq, is now standing trial, accused of being one of a nine-strong gang that attacked Mr Assani. Tariq was not tried with his brothers because \u2018he went to ground\u2019 after the attack, hiding in Birmingham and then Bradford, Nottingham Crown Court heard. The 26-year-old, from Derby, who denies manslaughter, was arrested almost six months after the attack, in February. Mr Assani was attacked at around 3pm on Sunday, August 14 last year, after an incident involving his and Shahid\u2019s car as they were driving. Mr Assani\u2019s silver VW Golf was in front of Shahid\u2019s white BMW but when Shahid turned left, Mr Assani went around the traffic island and followed him. Shahid, 33, pulled up outside his home in Walbrook Road and Mr Assani stopped his car a couple of car-lengths in front. Two brothers, Mohammed Shahid and Mohammed Rafiq have already been convicted of killing Mr Assani and a third is on trial at the moment . Prosecutor Peter Joyce QC told the court that Mr Assani got out of his car to speak to the driver of the BMW, Shahid, while his son Mukhaila remained in the vehicle. The two men started arguing and Shahid shouted towards his house, calling for back-up. A man came out of the house, jogged over to Mr Assani and punched him, knocking him to the ground. Mr Joyce said: \u2018Both men set about repeatedly hitting Mr Assani, using fists and feet, to punch and kick him to the head and body. \u2018And the only thing that Johnny Assani could do at that stage was to shield himself from the blows as he tried to get back up. He failed.\u2019 The court heard that at that point between seven and nine more men came out of the house and joined in kicking and punching Mr Assani as he lay on the ground. One man hung back and delivered a final kick to Mr Assani\u2019s head and walked off smiling, said Mr Joyce. M Joyce told a jury that as Mr Assani\u2019s attackers left him lying unconscious on the road, one shouted out: \u2018You don\u2019t mess with the Khans.\u2019 Mr Joyce told the court that Mr Assani was killed by members of the Khan family, including Shahid, Rafiq and Tarip together with other men. After the attack, Ellen Shreeve, who lived nearby and had seen the commotion from her house, rushed out to give Mr Assani first aid until paramedics arrived. She said: \u2018I heard all the shouting in the street and had a look what all the fuss was. I saw a big group of people - around 15 to 20 - outside a house further down the street, around number 118. \u2018When the crowds had dispersed I saw the person lying on the street and rushed out. I\u2019m first aid trained and took my first aid kit with me. \u2018I recognised Mukhaila when I got out and then saw the man on the ground was his father. \u2018I helped stem the bleeding and tried to calm both of them down while the paramedics arrived.\u2019 The victim was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital and a CT scan showed he had suffered \u2018a large bleed in his brain\u2019. He was transferred to the Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham, where he died in the intensive care unit after suffering a cardiac arrest a day after the attack. A post-mortem examination revealed he had suffered significant bruising to his back, chest, upper abdomen and to his right jaw. He had also lost a tooth which had lodged in his throat. Tariq\u2019s DNA was found in a blood sample taken from the nails of Mr Assani\u2019s right hand, the jury was told. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- What makes airline passengers happy? Sometimes it's as simple as a smile. Along with mobile check-in, Wi-Fi in the air and other technological advances, the simple act of airline employees smiling is increasing airline passenger satisfaction. Airline passenger satisfaction has improved to its highest levels since 2006, according to J.D Power & Associates' 2013 North America Airline Satisfaction Study released Wednesday. U.S. airlines collect $6 billion in fees . \"Traditional carriers have improved significantly across the entire passenger experience, and it is a positive sign to see them turn a corner and starting to rise again, even as there is still more opportunity to improve,\" said Jessica McGregor, senior manager of J.D. Power's global travel and hospitality practice. \"While satisfaction with low-cost carriers only slightly improves, greater gains in the rest of the experience are masked by lower passenger satisfaction with cost and fees.\" The study measures passenger satisfaction with North American airlines based on the following criteria in order of importance: costs and fees; in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew; aircraft; check-in; and reservations. Satisfaction improved in every category, but the largest yearly increases were in the boarding/deplaning/baggage, check-in and aircraft categories. JetBlue, Southwest top the airline rankings . For the ninth consecutive year, JetBlue Airways ranked first for satisfaction among all North American airlines. JetBlue also earned the top score among low-cost carriers for the eighth year in a row. Southwest Airlines was a close second among discount carriers with 770 points to JetBlue's 787. Airlines are ranked on a 1,000-point scale. \"Above all, we're grateful for our 15,000 crewmembers that inspire humanity each and every day by going above and beyond to deliver the best customer service in the skies and on the ground,\" said JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg, via email. Alaska Airlines topped the traditional carrier rankings, with Delta Air Lines in second place. Alaska scored 717 points and Delta scored 682 points. \"We're honored to receive this prestigious recognition from our customers,\" said Alaska Air Group President and CEO Brad Tilden, in a statement. \"Receiving this award six years in a row is a credit to the 13,000 Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air employees who show their dedication to our customers every day and on every flight.\" Overall satisfaction with the airlines improved to 695 on the 1,000 point scale, a 14-point increase over the 2012 survey. The power of a smile . Despite passengers choosing to check in online rather than talk to someone at an airport ticket counter, how an airline's employees treat customers still counts. Passengers who are greeted by airline staff with a smile, even infrequently, report satisfaction scores that are 105 points higher than among those who never get a smile. Passengers who report airline staff smiling at them consistently report satisfaction scores that are 211 points higher than those who do not get any airline smiles. \"Airlines don't have to invest millions of dollars in the aircraft to get employees to smile,\" said McGregor. A few trainings, including information about the impact on customer satisfaction, may help the cabin and cockpit crew make better eye contact and smile more, she said. Of course it helps to have happy employees. \"One of things we see is that when you see companies that have high internal employee satisfaction, they have high customer satisfaction as well,\" she said. Customers love technology . Now a smile doesn't take care of everything. Customers also want their technology. Those who use Wi-Fi in-flight are happier (39 points happier) than those who do not use it. More than one-third of customers surveyed check in online, and 15% of those technologically savvy fliers use their smartphones or other mobile devices (compared to 6% two years ago). Passengers checking in via mobile applications are the happiest of all fliers checking into their flights, followed by passengers who check in using a mobile device, passengers who check in at an airport kiosk and those who use the main ticket counter. Baggage fees still lower satisfaction . Even attitudes toward baggage fees are beginning to soften. Although passengers are still dissatisfied with being charged for something that used to be included in the price of a plane ticket, they aren't as grumpy about it. The gap between passengers who pay for baggage and those who do not pay shrank to 63 points this year, compared with an 85 point gap last year and a 100 point gap in 2011. Some 37% of passengers who pay for bags agree that the fees are reasonable, compared to 28% last year and 18% in 2011. \"Baggage fees are still a point of contention for people, and it's still a 'disatisfier,' but people are starting to accept it's a cost to travel,\" said McGregor. To help reduce costs, J.D. Power recommends using an airline's mobile application to check in, select seats and receive an electronic boarding pass. If you don't have an airline credit card or frequent flier status to waive baggage fees, look for discounts when checking in online. The passenger satisfaction study is based on responses from more than 11,800 passengers who flew on a major North America airline between April 2012 and March 2013. Overall airline rankings . Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines topped the traditional carrier rankings, followed by Air Canada (671 points), American Airlines (660), United Airlines (641) and US Airways (630). Low-cost carriers JetBlue and Southwest were followed by WestJet (714), Frontier Airlines (708) and AirTran Ariways (705). (AirTran is now part of Southwest.)

But Nissan has trialled technology that means cars could glow-in-the-dark  on the roads to become more visible.

The \u2018ultraviolet-energised paint\u2019 on the Nissan Leaf electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials. Known as Starpath, the paint is applied by spraying and absorbs UV energy from the sun throughout the day. It is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down. The paint is the brainchild of Surrey-based inventor Hamish Scott, who is already trialling glow-in-the-dark cycle paths in Cambridge.

It\u2019s made from very rare earth materials, including Strontium Aluminate, which is solid, odourless and chemically and biologically inert. However, the paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale. People can, however, have the treatment applied to their own car or buy UV car \u2018wraps\u2019 to enable their car to glow-in-the-dark. This would enable them to find their car easily in a dark car park, as well as making them more visible on pitch black roads. Nissan told Autoexpress that if the paint was ever offered, the glow would probably last for around 25 years. The experiment was done to showcase the increasing number of Leaf owners who are charging their cars using solar energy. Nissan says its eco-friendly car costs less than two pence per mile to run and that 89 per cent of Leaf owners in the UK charge their cars at home overnight. The paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients in the paint mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale. However, glow-in-the-dark cars could prove useful for making vehicles extra visble on dark country roads (pictured) A trial of the Starpath technology is under way in Cambridge city centre, where a spray has been applied to cyclepaths to make them glow. The luminescent, rain-resistant coating could one day replace street lights. It is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark. The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together. According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood. Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light. \u2018This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,\u2019 said Mr Scott, who owns the firm. \u2018If the sky is lighter, it won\u2019t release as much luminosity \u2013 it adjusts accordingly, it\u2019s almost like it has a mind of its own.\u2019 Nasa has teamed up with car manufacturer Nissan to develop new self-driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of Mars. The technology created during the five-year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on Earth. Robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from Nissan to adapt the company's electric Leaf cars. Future rovers on Mars could look more like Nissan's Leaf electric cars (pictured) as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with Nasa to create self-driving vehicles that could be used on Earth and in space . Nissan has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020, but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads. However, Nasa believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians, cyclists, overtaking vehicles and parked cars, could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets. t is not the first project that Nasa and Nissan have collaborated on. In 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats. Nissan drew upon data from Nasa's Human Research Program at its Johnson Space Centre that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity. Nissan used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots.",

Under the Chancellor's plan, employees will receive as little as \u00a32,000 when they agree not to sue their employers if they are mistreated or unfairly dismissed. Workers will also be required to give up their right to time off for training purposes, give longer notice if they intend to return to their jobs after parental leave and lose their redundancy protections. Scroll down for video . George Osborne (centre)  delivered his speech to the Tory conference yesterday before travelling to an EU finance ministers meeting where today he met French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, left, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble . Compromise: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne offered a bargain to workers in his speech in Birmingham . A week after Labour attempted to . hijack the Tories\u2019 \u2018one nation\u2019 philosophy, Mr Osborne jokingly used the . Marxist slogan, \u2018Workers of the world, unite\u2019. Business leaders hailed the proposal . as a key step towards a more dynamic and flexible workforce, and the . Chancellor\u2019s aides predicted hundreds of thousands of employees would . take up the offer. But it infuriated union leaders, who . accused the Government of chiselling away at employment rights and . insisted few workers would be interested. Under the scheme, \u2018employee-owners\u2019 will be given between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000 of shares by their firms that . will be exempt from capital gains tax when sold. In return, they will agree to give up . their right to claim unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, the right to . request flexible working or time off for training and will have to give . twice as much notice of intent to return from parental leave. Legislation to bring in the new . optional contract will be introduced later this year and be put into law . in time for companies to use it from April next year. Announcing the policy to the Tory . conference in Birmingham, Mr Osborne said it would appeal to new . businesses starting up and small and medium-sized firms who need . flexible labour and highly-motivated staff. In a sombre speech, the Chancellor . insisted he would not be diverted from his plans to cut the deficit, . despite the double dip recession. Mr Osborne was joined by his wife Francis to walk back over the bridge to the Hyatt Hotel after his speech . Former minister: Tory grandee Edwina Currie at the Conservative Party Conference . The share option plan unveiled yesterday . combines Tory demands for less business red tape and a Lib Dem policy to . encourage more employee-ownership. Staff would be offered \u00a32,000 to \u00a350,000 of which would be exempt from any capital gains tax. They would then give up their rights to claim unfair . dismissal, statutory redundancy pay, requesting flexible working and . asking for longer parental leave. Employee-owner shares would be optional for existing staff but it could be compulsory for new hires or start-up firms. Legislation will be fast-tracked so the changes can come into force from April 2013. The scheme could cost \u00a3100m in 2017-18. Government sources said they expected take up to be highest among fast-growing small and mid-sized businesses. Mr . Osborne said: 'Get shares and become owners of the company you work . for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it together.' He insisted he would not repeat the . mistakes of Edward Heath in 1972, who \u2018two years into office was faced . with economic problems and over powerful unions buckled and gave up\u2019. He attempted to woo the \u2018strivers\u2019 who handed Margaret Thatcher three election victories, saying the party . represented \u2018all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who . feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out\u2019. \u2018Whether it\u2019s the owner of the corner . shop staying open until midnight to support their family, or the . teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the . after-school club,\u2019 the Chancellor added. Or the commuter who leaves home before . the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, . because they want a better life for them. Or the pensioner, who has . saved all their life, and doesn\u2019t want to spend it all as they want to . pass something on to their children. \u2018Or the entrepreneur who doesn\u2019t cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story. \u2018They are all part of one nation \u2013 one nation working together to get on. That is the nation we represent.\u2019 Mr Osborne won big cheers as he flatly . rejected Liberal Democrat demands for a \u2018mansion tax\u2019 on expensive . properties \u2013 warning that \u2018once the tax inspector had his foot in the . door you\u2019d soon find most homes in the country labelled a \u201cmansion\u201d, . homes people have worked hard to afford and already paid taxes on\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s not a mansion tax, it\u2019s homes tax and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it,\u2019 he declared. But he said those at the \u2018very top\u2019 would have to pay more towards the deficit reduction programme, as long . as it could be done without \u2018damaging the enterprise economy\u2019. He told delegates \u2018the economy is . healing\u2019 but warned that \u2018healing is taking longer than we hoped because . the damage was greater than we feared\u2019. The Chancellor announced that as . austerity measures continue into the next Parliament, he will continue . the current split of 80 per cent of the effort coming from reduced . spending and 20 per cent from taxes. Prime Minister David Cameron applauds as Chancellor George Osborne addresses the Tory party conference . The Chancellor's speech was well-received in Symphony Hall in Birmingham . He confirmed plans to slash a further . \u00a310billion from the welfare budget \u2013 proposing removing housing benefit . from the young unemployed and limits on handouts to jobless parents who . insist on having more children, without being able to afford them. George Osborne suffered a setback . last night as the International Monetary Fund said it now expects the UK . economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year \u2013 far worse than the growth . of 0.2 per cent it predicted in July. It also downgraded its 2013 growth . forecast from 1.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent \u2013 little more than half the 2 . per cent expected by the Treasury in another blow to the Chancellor. But there was better news from the . Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which said the . British economy is picking up even as the eurozone plunges deeper into . crisis. Mr Osborne also suggested that some of . the cuts would come from freezing benefits. He said: \u2018How can we . justify the incomes of those out-of-work rising faster than the incomes . of those in work?\u2019 Attacking Labour\u2019s demands for more . debt-fuelled public spending, he said: \u2018Our critics gamble everything: . our credibility, our financial stability, our low interest rates, the . cost of our debt \u2013 they would risk everything on the dubious idea that a . few billion more of spending would dramatically improve the fortunes of . a trillion and a half-pound British economy.\u2019 Unveiling his employee-ownership . scheme, he described it as a \u2018three way deal\u2019. \u2018You the company: give . your employees shares in the business. You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership,\u2019 he said. \u2018And what will the Government do? We\u2019ll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your . shares. Zero per cent capital gains tax for these new employee-owners. \u2018Get shares and become owners of the . company you work for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it . together. Workers of the world, unite.\u2019 The Chancellor waved briefly at the end of his speech before quickly leaving the stage .

We were sweating our a**** off, and there were very few people there.\" \"It was in a tent with no ventilation,\" Auerbach adds. \"It was the kind of hot where you're completely drenched, except for the top of your head where the heat's coming out of.\" Carney chuckles. \"So if we can make it through that, which is basically, like, Navy SEALs hell week for rock & roll -- this is, like, the Palm Springs retirement.\" \"Yeah,\" Auerbach says. \"We made it. We're, like, super-tough now. Tough as nails.\" Tonight, the Keys return to Coachella as the festival expands for the first time to a two-weekend blow-out. \"We actually had a blue-light special at our agent's office,\" Carney deadpans. \"Buy one, you get two.\" But they weren't planning any major setlist changes. Says Carney, \"We were told not one person from this festival will be there next weekend.\" \"That's what they told us,\" Auerbach adds slyly. \"We've also been told that 99 percent of the people here came to see us. We've also been told that we're Number One on the radio everywhere. We've surrounded ourselves with yes-men.\" Carney struggles to keep a straight face. \"Yeah. We actually hired some of LeBron's old people.\" The Keys have a busy year ahead, with gigs booked in Europe, North America and Australia, but they hope to get cracking on the follow-up to this year's \"El Camino\" during breaks from the road. \"We're going to start soon,\" Carney says. \"We're not sure how long it'll take, but I think we'd both like to put another record out next year. We've got to keep rolling the dice.\" \"Daddy needs a new car,\" says Auerbach. \"Yeah,\" Carney adds. \"We have to buy our dads new Yugos.\" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

Plackowska, 40, told them they were going to heaven and to get down on their knees and pray. Police found Plackowska covered in blood inside a suburban Naperville, Illinois, home and after extensive questioning, she allegedly told police that she murdered her son Justin, 7, and his friend Olivia Dworakowski because they 'had evil inside of them.' Prosecutors before a judge this morning said that Plackowska was fighting with her husband and felt unappreciated as a babysitter, so she murdered the children in a fit of rage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Murder charge: Elzbieta Plackowska and her son Justin (right), who was stabbed to death . Justin was found stabbed 100 times. Olivia was stabbed 50 times. Plackowska was denied bail. 'She told Justin he was going to heaven tonight as she repeatedly stabbed him,' DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin said to the court, according to the Daily Herald. 'He begged her to stop and said he loved her.' Mr Berlin described the scene that unfolded before the grisly murder, saying that the two children were jumping on their beds in Olivia's home, where Plackowska was meant to be babysitting her. The babysitter then ordered them to get down on the floor and pray before bed. 'The children had evil inside of them,' Plackowska allegedly told police. Mr Berlin said she 'was trying to drive the evil out of them. She said the devil was inside them.' Both children's throats were slit and Justin was found in a bed, Olivia on the floor. Prosecutors say that after Plackowska killed the innocents, she started frantically calling a local church, leaving numerous messages. Crime scene: The gruesome discovery of the bloody murders was made at this suburban home in Illinois . She then went to a friend's house and . claimed someone had robbed her. Her friend was suspicious of the story . because the details kept changing, Mr Berlin said. Meanwhile, Olivia's mother Marta . Dworakowski, a nurse, called police because when she returned home from . her night shift, Plackowska's car wasn't there and she could not get . into the house. Police were able to get inside the . suburban home on Quin Court just after 10pm and found blood all over the . hallway, leading them to the children's bedroom. 'Both victims had been stabbed numerous times,' Mr Berlin said. 'It appeared to police both victims' throats had been slashed.' Officers also found that the family's two dogs were also stabbed to death. When questioned by police, Plackowska . told them several stories, including one in which a stalker attacked . her own wrists. Eventually, they said, she admitted to killing the . children. She told them that she had been . fighting with her husband Artur, a truck driver, about his work schedule . and felt taken advantage of as a babysitter. The pair has a college age . son as well who has not been named. Sources told the Daily Herald that . Plackowska had been stressed for several days following the death of her . father and she was anxious to return to Poland, a decision her husband . objected to. Olivia was a kindergartner from Brookdale Elementary School and Justin attended Scott School in Naperville District 203. Police say that Plackowska is on suicide watch at the jail after she was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. 'In all my years in law enforcement, . this was the most horrific and gruesome crime scene I have seen,' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall said after the hearing today to . the Chicago Tribune. The tragedy comes less than a week . after a New York City baby sitter allegedly stabbed to death two young . children who were in her care before slashing her own throat and wrists . in an attempt to take her life.

        "article": "By . Jason Groves . Traditional county names like Middlesex and Cumberland could become a familiar sight again on England\u2019s roads after ministers yesterday lifted a ban on displaying them on street signs. In a move to mark St George\u2019s Day, the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said planning laws were being changed to allow councils to display traditional county names alongside more modern creations. Ministers are also consulting on a further change that would allow councils to erect stand-alone road signs telling motorists they have crossed an ancient boundary of counties like Huntingdonshire and Westmorland. Signs such as this one, formerly of Middlesex, could have their old counties on them to celebrate heritage . Mr Pickles said the change in the rules would make it easier for England to celebrate its own rich heritage. He said: \u2018The tapestry of England\u2019s counties binds our nation together, and is interwoven with our cultural fabric - from our cricket to our ales. Previous governments have tried to wipe the counties off the map, imposing bland administrative structures or alien euro-regions. \u2018But I believe we are stronger as a nation when we cherish and champion our local and traditional ties. 'This government is proud to wave the flag of St George alongside both our county flags. 'Whatever one\u2019s class, colour or creed, we should have pride in our English identities within the United Kingdom\u2019s Union that binds us together.\u2019 The boundaries of England\u2019s 39 traditional counties have remain largely unchanged since the Domesday Book. But successive waves of local government reorganisation, most notably Edward heath\u2019s 1972 shaek-up, have threatened to blur their boundaries and wipe some off the map altogether. Under existing laws the use of anything other than modern local authority names is classed as an advertisement. Stand-alone road signs may also be erected to highlight ancient boundaries such as Huntingdonshire . Blackpool cannot declare its Lancashire . heritage on signs because it is now a unitary authority. Similar rules . prevent Poole saying it is in Dorset or Torquay declaring it is in . Devon. TV astrologer Russell Grant, founder of the Association of British Counties, welcomed the announcement. The former Strictly Come Dancing Star said: \u2018This is great news for counties like my own, Middlesex. We lost our county council in 1965, but our county continues to exist. 'Some London boroughs like Hounslow have actively supported Middlesex signs on their boundaries, and Brentford Chamber of Commerce are keen to proclaim the town as the historic county town of Middlesex. Flashback: Eric Pickles announced the plan to put old counties' names on street signs to mark St George's Day . 'These common sense changes will give local councils and communities the confidence to promote historic local heritage and identity.\u2019 Ministers believe reviving the use of Britain\u2019s traditional county names could foster a sense of national pride and boost tourism. A source said: \u2018They provide an instant means of reference to different parts of the country, to a set of cities, towns and villages, to distinctive scenery, architecture and wildlife, to particular industries and pastimes, accents and dialect, tourist attractions and so on. \u2018A large literature focuses on each of the counties - they give their names to clubs and societies, to teams people play for, to regiments they serve in. 'And they often provide a family link with past generations.\u2019 Under the new planning guidance on advertising, councils will be deemed to have the power to use traditional county names on signs provided they do not create dangerous roadside clutter. The guidance states: \u2018Local authorities may install signs indicating the boundary of a historic or traditional county on their land. Depending on circumstances, such signs may benefit from deemed consent. \u2018Authorities need to bear in mind how such sign-posting can benefit the local economy and reflect this through the decision-taking process, where such signs are appropriate and locally-supported.\u2019 However, the move comes just days after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin warned councils to cut down on the excessive number of signs cluttering Britain\u2019s roads. Regulations are set to be tightened up after research by the Department for Transport found the total number of road signs has more than doubled in the last 20 years to 4.5 million.",

Attacks on civilians, the torture of detainees and unfair trials permeate the country, Amnesty International said. The report said government forces commit torture with impunity, especially against those arrested on suspicion of carrying out terrorism acts. There was no immediate reaction from the Iraqi government. Methods of torture . Methods of torture reported by detainees include electric shocks; including to the genitals; partial suffocation with a bag placed tightly over the head; beatings while suspended in contorted positions; and the deprivation of food, water and sleep, Amnesty said. \"Detainees have alleged that they were tortured to force them to 'confess' to serious crimes or to incriminate others while held in these conditions,\" the group said. \"Many have repudiated their confessions at trial only to see the courts admit them as evidence of their guilt, without investigating their torture allegations, sentencing them to long term imprisonment or death.\" 129 hangings . Such death sentences contribute to one of the highest execution rates in the world, Amnesty said. Last year, 129 Iraqi prisoners were hanged. \"Death sentences and executions are being used on a horrendous scale,\" Sahraoui said. \"It is particularly abhorrent that many prisoners have been sentenced to death after unfair trials and on the basis of confessions they say they were forced to make under torture.\" Amnesty International opposes the death penalty worldwide. Sectarian strife . Sectarian strife also continues to plague the country, where Shiite Muslims dominate the central government. Thousands of demonstrators in Sunni-dominated areas have protested the arbitrary detention and abuse of detainees, Amnesty said. The protesters also denounced what they say is government discrimination against the Sunni population. Sunni armed groups, meanwhile, continue to attack not only government targets but also Shiite civilians, including religious pilgrims, the group said. Last month, Iraq's top judicial committee accused Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi denied those allegations, saying they are politically motivated. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion in Iraq. The country has struggled to define itself, even after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011. Violence has dropped dramatically But insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist. Many areas are still smoldering with sectarian tension and political infighting. CNN's Neda Farshbaf contributed to this report.",

        "article": "(Mental Floss) -- 1. Cordless tools . Your life may be safer and more comfortable because of inventions that came from space research. As long as NASA was going to the trouble of sending Apollo astronauts to the moon, it figured it might as well equip them with drills and ask them to dig up rock samples when they got there. But realizing that a 239,000-mile extension cord would be impractical, NASA teamed up with Black & Decker to develop tools that featured rechargeable batteries and special low-power consumption motors, which should make your DustBuster seem a lot more impressive. 2. Smoke detectors . In the 1970s, NASA partnered with Honeywell Corp. to create a device that would detect smoke and toxic gases in Skylab, America's first space station. The result was the first ionization smoke detector, using a minute amount of the radioactive isotope Americium-241. This led to the 1979 introduction of inexpensive photoelectric detection devices, which go off when smoke (or sometimes a hot, steamy shower) blocks the light beam. To date, smoke detectors have saved countless lives here on Earth, but they're especially useful in space, where running outside to wait for the fire truck isn't an option. 3. Enriched baby food . NASA-sponsored research has also helped make major improvements to commercially available baby food, and we're not talking about freeze-dried strained peas. While testing the potential of algae as a food supply for long-duration space travel, a Maryland-based biosciences company discovered an algae additive that contains two fatty acids closely resembling those found in human breast milk. The company now uses it to make an enriched infant formula called Formulaid, thought to be essential for babies' visual and mental development. 4. New-age pavement . When you buy a new set of tires, the old ones have to go somewhere, right? Most of them end up in huge, flammable tire dumps, which may hold millions of old tires, each one containing about a quart of oil in the rubber. If a dump catches fire, however, it can burn with a thick, toxic smoke for weeks on end. But today, old tires are being put to good use. NASA's experience in fuel-related cryogenics helped develop processes to freeze the tires to below -200 degrees Fahrenheit so that they crumble, separating the rubber from other materials and producing what's called \"crumb.\" This waste is recycled into several new products, including an ingredient used to pave highways, which means your new radial tires may someday be rolling over your old ones. 5. Those cool ear thermometers . Any parent knows you don't take a baby's temperature by sticking a glass thermometer in its mouth, but inserting it the other way isn't much fun, either. And what about the incapacitated patient who can't even say \"aaah\"? The Diatek Corp. of California wanted a safer way to take a person's temperature, and who better to turn to than NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the place with over 30 years of experience using infrared sensors to remotely observe celestial bodies? Together, they developed a fast and accurate thermometer that, when its disposable probe cover (to prevent cross-infection) is inserted into the ear canal, detects infrared radiation from the eardrum and gives a digital readout in less than two seconds. 6. Fast-acting dental braces . Do your old-fashioned braces set off airport metal detectors? Save yourself embarrassing strip searches by getting new ones. Many orthodontists now use ceramic braces that are bonded to the teeth and strung together with a thin, light wire made of NiTinol (nickel-titanium), an alloy brought to you compliments of NASA. Because of its amazing ability to maintain its original shape, NiTi (as it's known in the industry) provides space satellites with the ability to spring open after being cramped and contorted inside a rocket. But don't think its capabilities are limited to space. When used in dental appliances, NiTi exerts a continuous force against the teeth to move in the right direction, eliminating the need for wire tightening, thus reducing a patient's overall time in braces ... and much of the pain. 7. Protective paint . What do the Statue of Liberty, a gigantic Buddha in Hong Kong and the Golden Gate Bridge all have in common? They're protected by the American space program ... sort of. In the late 1980s, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center began a research program to develop coatings for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to shield the launch structures from salt-air corrosion, rocket exhaust and thermal stress. Applications of this material proved ideal for protecting structures like bridges, antenna towers and the occasional big Buddha. 8. (Better) cardiac pacemakers . Pacemakers have come a long way since their invention in 1950. Far from the large, external contraptions used early on, modern pacemakers can self-adjust in most cases and even activate themselves when needed. But one of the most significant advances in pacemaker technology came in the 1970s, with the help of a NASA-developed system of communication called bi-directional telemetry, originally used to communicate with satellites. Siemens-Pacesetter, Inc. teamed with NASA to develop a similar telemetry system, which not only allows doctors to make changes to the unit's function over time, but also updates them on how the device is interacting with the patient -- all without picking up a scalpel. 9. Scratch-resistant glasses . Thanks to NASA technology, plastic lenses for glasses last up to 10 times longer than they used to. That's because its Ames Research Center created a scratch-resistant (read: extremely hard) coating to protect equipment from getting beaten up by space debris. Later, the Foster Grant Corp. acquired the license for the coating method and used it in their plastic sunglasses, which matched the hardness of glass lenses, but were much lighter. Among other uses, it's now employed in most eyewear and industrial face shields. 10. Oh-so comfy sneaker insoles . Can't run a five-minute mile? Don't blame your sneakers. If they're relatively new, they're probably giving you quite a bit of help already. In the 1970s, many shoe manufacturers began replacing their standard foam rubber insoles with a new, highly shock-absorbent material -- one giant step for tennis shoes. The new kicks were padded with \"viscoelastic\" bubbles that conformed to your foot and then returned to their normal shape when you took the shoes off. Turns out, they got the idea (and the technology) from NASA, which had developed the material to better cushion astronauts during blastoff. And one pop culture killer . Despite popular theory, NASA did NOT invent Tang orange breakfast drink for the astronauts. It was introduced in 1957 by General Foods and was on grocery store shelves for years before NASA decided it worked well in space. E-mail to a friend .

July Fourth: This post from July 4th was littered with comments like 'That's a good lifestyle bro' Private planes: The multimillionaire is regularly seen outside his private jet . Gun enthusiast: He wrote: 'Bought these sexy twins for the duck hunt in December #onesnotenough' Now, Honig . said Bilzerian is in perfect health while seemingly continuing to make . the mega-bucks and enjoy spending them.

Wyeth, 91, died in his sleep Thursday night at his home near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to Lora Englehart, public relations coordinator for the museum.

Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 2007, President Bush awarded Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture. Two years earlier, Wyeth and his wife, Betsy, presented to the White House his painting \"Jupiter,\" which is displayed in the residence's family sitting room. Bush issued a statement Friday saying that he and first lady Laura Bush \"deeply mourn\" the death of Wyatt. \"Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine,\" Bush said. \"On behalf of the American people, Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family.\" Wyeth, who lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Maine, \"has been enormously popular and critically acclaimed since his first one-man show in 1937,\" according to a biography in InfoPlease. His main subjects were the places and people of Chadds Ford and Cushing, Maine. \"Christina's World,\" painted in 1948, shows a disabled Maine neighbor who drags herself through a field toward her house in the distance. The painting, displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, has been regarded as Wyeth's most popular. \"His 'Helga' pictures, a large group of intimate portraits of a neighbor, painted over many years, were first shown publicly in 1986,\" the InfoPlease biography says. Those were painted in Pennsylvania. Wyeth, the youngest child of painter N.C. Wyeth, formally studied art with his father as a teen, \"drawing in charcoal and painting in oils, the media of choice for N.C. Wyeth. It was during the family's annual summer vacations in Port Clyde, Maine, that Andrew was able to experiment with other media to find his own artistic voice,\" according to a biography in the Farnsworth Art Museum in Maine.",

This weekend sees the switch to British Summer Time and, appropriately, it has been met with the first surprise heatwave of the year. Far from the usual case of it being summer time in name only, Britain will today bask in temperatures up to 10C higher than the seasonal average, forecasters said. The heatwave is expected to hit the south hardest, with predicted maximum temperatures of 21C (69.8F) in Berkshire, Surrey and Hampshire. Bright and early: Personal trainer Tara Hammett makes the most of the warm weather this morning at Langland Bay, near Swansea, south Wales . Spring has sprung: Three-year-old Sophie Rhian enjoying the warm weather by a bed of flowers in Victoria Park, Swansea, south Wales . Yesterday was the warmest day of the . year so far with the mercury reaching 21.3C (70.3F) in Charlwood, . Surrey. And in London the weather was so warm it spurred an air quality . alert, with pollution measuring at nine on the ten-point scale. The warm weather is being caused by a . high pressure system in the North Sea which is sucking warm air from in . from France and northern Continental Europe. For the next few days London is . expected to be warmer than typically sun-soaked capitals much further . south like Madrid, Rome and even Athens. But . although the temperatures are unseasonal, they won\u2019t make the record . books. The hottest March day was 25.6c (78f) at Mepal in Cambridgeshire . on March 29, 1968. Paul Mott, forecaster at MeteoGroup, . the weather division of the Press Association, said that temperatures . will be well in excess of expectations for this time of year. 'There will be plenty of warm sunshine for most areas of the UK, and the highest temperatures will be around 20-21C. 'Across much of the UK temperatures will generally be around 15-19C. We're up to 10C above the seasonal average.' Who needs to go abroad? Two students lap up the . sun on the beach in Bournemouth yesterday, where it may end up getting hotter than . Bermuda this weekend . Soaking up the rays: Three-year-old Jack Manning, left, makes the most of the unseasonably high temperatures near Portsmouth while, right, Elsie Saunders, four, and her brother Charlie, one, enjoy the sun and make sandcastles on the beach in Torquay, Devon . Lapping it up: Sunseekers crammed on to Brighton beach this afternoon as everyone sought to make the most of the unseasonably good weather . Sunshine and showers: The temperatures experienced in places like Brighton today were said to be around 10 degrees warmer than normal . Beach bodies: Met Office weather experts believe the hot weather could continue into next week . Mr Mott said the highest temperatures tomorrow will be in Aberdeenshire, which is expected to reach 20C (68F). It will be less warm in southern England, but still around 18C (64.4F). The pleasant conditions caused by high . pressure are expected to continue into next week, with no significant . drop in temperatures until next weekend. 'It's looking fine and warm for much . of the coming week,' Mr Mott said. 'It will last until until at least . Thursday or Friday and will probably be milder next weekend.' He described the current spell of warm . weather as 'quite unusual' for March, and warned there was no . significant rainfall in the drought-affected areas of southern England. Sun trap: Residents in Portsmouth catch rays on the beach at the city's historic hot walls, a rare day out for this time of year . Chilling out: The mercury is expected to remain at similar levels throughout the weekend and into next week, although some parts of the UK, particularly east Suffolk, may have it spoiled by cloud . Don't forget the suncream! Residents in Portsmouth get into the spirit of summer months early . Idyllic: Horse riders enjoy the spring sunshine in Hyde Park, left, as boaters enjoy themselves on the river Cam in Cambridge, right . Helen Chivers, a meteorologist at the Met Office, also said that the unseasonal weather would continue into next week. 'We are expecting the warm weather to . carry on into the weekend and next week. We may well see a change . towards the end of next week with things becoming cooler, but it is . quite a long way out for us to say for definite that this will be the . case,' she said. Meanwhile the gardeners at Cornish . National Trust mansion Cotehele are celebrating as the peak blossom time . of their daffodils has coincided with their annual weekend celebrating . the plant. A spokesman said it is the first time in four years they have got their timing perfect for the two-day event. 'It will be a fantastic chance for . garden lovers and families to see our wonderful collection of historic . daffodils, including some varieties which are 200 years old,' said . senior gardener Aimee Kingdom. The gardens are open from 11am to 4pm. Yesterday the Woodland Trust asked . people to look out for the first bluebells of the year as it tracks the . blooming of wildflowers across the UK. The charity said that just over 50 . sightings have been reported so far - almost twice as many as were . called in at this time last year. But don\u2019t get too used to the good weather \u2013 last year\u2019s warm spring was followed by a washout summer. The . dry conditions also spell further difficulties for water companies, which . fear a prolonged drought and have already warned of hosepipe bans. At ease: Soldiers from 8th Platoon, C Company 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment cram in a last 'Operation Bronze' as they panic tan on top of a wall at Patrol Base (PB) Clifton, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . The Environment Agency said: \u2018It\u2019s . been the driest March since records began in 1910 and it\u2019s not looking . likely that we\u2019ll have enough rain to avoid a widespread drought this . summer. \u2018We\u2019re working with . farmers to keep them going through the summer and we have new . regulations to produce environmental sites like wetlands. It\u2019s our job . to make sure everybody gets water and the environment is protected. It\u2019s . been a very, very dry week and river levels are continuing to decrease. \u2018Obviously, it\u2019s nice to have a sunny weekend but what we really need at the moment is a prolonged period of rainfall. \u2018On . hot weekends, we should all try to use less water. If we all can use a . little less, we can make the most of what we have.\u2019 Cool: Rowers on the mist-covered River Cam in Cambridge this morning . Spring gone already?

John Guest left his unique Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG - which costs \u00a3170,000 to buy new - with technicians at a Mercedes dealer near his home in Poole, Dorset, to fix problems with its onboard computer. Just hours after he had dropped his pride and joy off at Sandown Mercedes he received a call to say the flash motor had crashed on a nearby dual carriageway. John Guest was shocked to recieve a call from the garage hours later to say his Mercedes Benz SL65 AMG had been involved in a smash on a nearby dual carriageway . The dealership claims the car, which . boasts a six-litre engine and a top speed of 180mph, was being driven . 'legally and sensibly' when it spun off the road in bad weather. Mr Guest, 56, bought the car in 2010 and has since spent \u00a330,000 on maintaining it. He said he is now considering legal action against the dealership. The semi-retired IT consultant, said: 'When I took the car in I . told them there was also a problem with the traction control system but I . was assured nothing was wrong. 'Later that day I got the phone call from the garage to say my car had been involved in a crash. 'My first concern was for the safety of the driver who thankfully wasn't hurt. The Mercedes crashed on a dual carriageway just six miles from the Mercedes dealership . Mr Guest, 56, from Poole, Dorset, bought the car for \u00a340,000 in 2010 and has since spent \u00a330,000 on maintaining it . 'The dealership tried to take it directly to a bodyshop but I demanded to see it. 'I . thought the car might have been involved in a minor crash but I . couldn't believe it when I saw it - it was totally written off and will . have to be scrapped. 'There was a tear in my eye because I have so many fond memories of the car. It was a car for life and it's irreplaceable. 'The thing that angers me most is the suggestion the car was being sensibly driven. 'Thousands of cars drove down that road that day, only three crashed and mine was the only one to be totally wrecked. Mr Guest's Mercedes was the sought after SL65 AMG. Price: \u00a3170,000 new . Pearlescent paint job: \u00a325,000 - this is the only one of 90 cars in Britain to have this option . Engine: V12 twin-turbo . Power: 630bhp . Gearbox: seven-speed automatic .

'It . is very galling given that I haven't done anything wrong. My only . mistake was leaving my car with the dealership in the first place.' The flash motor was one of only 90 in the country and is the only one with a \u00a325,000 pearlescent paint job. Mr Guest was given a courtesy car, a . Mercedes Benz E350, by the garage and is now pursuing a settlement . through his insurance company. He added: 'The bottom line is that I have lost something that is irreplaceable. My car was unique and I don't think I am being unreasonable to ask for a replacement.' Gavin . McAllister, managing director of the Sandown Group of Mercedes . dealerships, said: 'I was distressed to learn of the incident with Mr . Guest's car, and I'm relieved that no one else was involved in this . unfortunate accident. 'As . soon as it happened, we co-operated fully with the authorities, and the . police have confirmed that the car was being driven legally and . sensibly in the road conditions. 'This . is cold comfort for Mr Guest of course, who is a loyal and valued . customer, and I along with everyone in my team at Sandown are committed . to doing the right thing by him. 'We're working closely with the insurance team and are keeping Mr Guest fully informed throughout. 'Of course, we've provided a new courtesy car to keep him mobile in the meantime.

To plan for its visit to each city, one of the first orders of business is finding a place to stay. During their time in London earlier this year, the cast and crew stayed in the London Bridge area in 85 apartments. \"For London, it's really nice that we have everyone in the same place, but in Madrid, we're in 24 different places,\" said Jerome Vezina, the travel and lodging coordinator. He says they work on housing for about three cities at the same time. Everyone must pack for all seasons, taking everything they will need all year round. Each of these ultimate road warriors is allowed three suitcases -- two to send ahead and one to travel with. \"We don't live in the present -- sometimes it's sad to say like that -- we really live in the future,\" Deslandes said. More than just a circus, Kooza is a community that includes two physiotherapists and four chefs. Teachers provide schooling for the younger performers. For 15-year-old Mongolian contortionists, it's straight from math class to warm-ups for the next show. But learning on the road has its benefits, according to Thierry DeGagne, one of the teachers. \"My student is reading about Rosetta Stone, and we're going to visit it,\" she said.",

        "article": "When Amer Deghayes graduated from a college in Brighton with a qualification in business studies  this summer, he had his whole future ahead of him. Rather than start a career, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and travel to Syria in order to had out aid to the needy. But once inside the country he quickly joined forces with the al-Nusra Front, and al-Queda linked group fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . Worse still, his brothers Abdullah, then 18 and due to start a University course in his home-town, and Jaffar, 17, followed after him. Their mother,\u00a0Einas Abulsayen, said that the two younger boys left without warning, after the youngest tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. She said just before leaving Jaffar asked her for a cuddle. She didn't realise she was holding her son for what could prove to be the last time. On the way to the airport, the boys met up with long-term family friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who had stolen his 15-year-old brother's passport before going to join them. Despite being unaccompanied by an adult, all three are believed to have caught a flight from Luton airport to Turkey, where they found their way into Syria. Abubaker Deghayes went to see his three sons several times in the next few months in several unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to come home. He insists that during this time he believed the boys were still working for aid charities, but in April, he came face to face with the truth. While Amer had once been an intelligent college student, earning a qualification in business studies, once in Syria he joined the al-Nusra Front, an al-Queda affiliated group fighting Bashar al-Assad . Amer's father travelled  to see his sons, who refused to come home and insisted they were working with aid charities. But in April he learned the truth when Amer called to say Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian sniper . His eldest son Amer, called to say his younger brother Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian army sniper in Kassab. Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. 'You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Then, last week, Mrs Kamara also got a call from Amer. Over Skype he explained that Ibrahim had also been killed, this time by one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria after his compound was hit. The three brothers were joined by another Brighton student, Ibrahim\u00a0Kamara, 19, who stole his 15-year-old brother's passport before flying from Luton airport to fight in Syria . His mother Kadiatu Kamara (pictured) also recieved a call from Amer last week to say her son had been killed in one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria, which hit a compound he was in . He explained that Ibrahim, who  was the going by the name of Khalil al-Britani, had recorded a message on his phone for his family in case he died, but the phone had been destroyed. With airstrikes intensifying, and fighting in Syria growing fiercer by the day, the Deghayes family fear they will never see their remaining two sons again. In part, they blame British authorities for telling teenage jihadis that they will face prosecution if they return to the UK. Mr Deghayes believes there should be an amnesty to allow his boys to come home. Both parents insist that their sons are not 'terrorists',\u00a0merely selfless boys who travelled to Syria to 'help defend those who are weak.' Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died. The\u00a0Deghayes' parents insist their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak. They now fear they will never see their two remaining sons again . Those who have died include Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, who is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The married father of three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Photographs were also published in January of two British brothers, named in reports as Akra and Mohamed Sebah from north London, who were believed to have died in battle in the war-torn country in September.",

Since 1993, she and her group, Maiti Nepal, have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 victims. Below are her thoughts on being chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero. Q: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Anuradha Koirala: The day I found out that I'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero, I was in Delhi, India. I'd had meetings with Indian and Nepalese government officials, police officers and [nongovernmental organizations] that are partnering with us regarding rescue and repatriation of Nepali girls. I also went to meet Nepali girls at a government remand home in Delhi. We had four girls rescued last week, so I was talking to all the children. The police officers were very positive, but one lawyer was acting very \"smart\" [about not wanting the girls to return home to Nepal]. I said to him: \"We are all working for the benefit of the children. So legal things are one part, but when there are girls, you have to send the girls back to their own country. That is all I want.\" So the whole morning and afternoon, I had been fighting. I was very excited and thankful to get the news. I have a big family, about 2,000 children and girls. This was a moment for us to cry, hug and remember how we started, what we have gained and where we are today. Q: What does it mean to you to have been selected by the Blue Ribbon Panel? Koirala: It means they have given priority to this heinous crime against humanity. We have to fight against this crime and protect the children from this. Q: What do you want people to know most about the importance of your work? Koirala: I would like to urge all the human beings around the world: Please close your eyes and imagine these girls are your daughters, and you will feel the pain of being trafficked.",

'We spoke to the planning department who, to our surprise, loved the idea. They agreed in principle to give us three years to trial the project, so we started to build it.

The Labour leader, who is facing a revolt over his \u2018complacent\u2019 strategy for winning power, dismissed suggestions that health spokesman Andy Burnham was also plotting to succeed him. Both Mr Johnson, 64, and Mr Burnham, who ran in the last Labour leadership campaign, have been touted as potential replacements. There were claims last night that Mr Johnson would take the top job if it was offered in a \u2018coronation\u2019 rather than a contested election. Alan Johnson (left), has been touted as a possible replacement for incumbent Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) The charismatic former home secretary insisted his answer to those urging him to make a leadership bid was: \u2018No, no, no, no, no.\u2019 Asked if Labour\u2019s chances of success would be improved if he went, an irritated Mr Miliband answered: \u2018I don\u2019t.

David Cameron, meanwhile, has opened up a staggering 42-point lead over Mr Miliband on the question of leadership. There is growing unrest over the Labour leader\u2019s alleged plan to secure victory by winning around 35 per cent of the vote \u2013 core Labour supporters plus disaffected Liberal Democrats. A poll set alarm bells ringing this week by suggesting a sharp fall in the number of Lib Dems switching to Labour.

Former cabinet minister and 'ultra' Blairite Lord Adonis (pictured) has been tipped for a comeback . Former Cabinet minister Lord Adonis, an \u2018ultra\u2019 Blairite who masterminded the academies programme, is tipped for a comeback.

He refused to endorse another Labour politician to replace Mr Miliband, but said: \u2018Alan Johnson at least has the advantage of talking like a human being.\u2019 Mr Miliband is also under pressure to make a strong attempt to deliver a Labour victory in another by- election in Rochester, Kent, amid signs the party plans to sit back as the Tories and Ukip slug it out. Former defence minister Lord Moonie said his party needed to do more to reflect the concerns of ordinary voters: \u2018The concerns of voters in Rochester should be ours too, if we wish to win our targets. Poverty of aspiration has never to my knowledge been a winning strategy. \u2018We must inspire people. As a confirmed anti-EU campaigner, I believe for a start we should be offering a referendum on in/out. We must also address legitimate concerns of our working-class core support on migration and jobs.\u2019 John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, called for a significant reshuffle \u2013 accusing his party of becoming too metropolitan. \u2018This problem is well beyond Ed Miliband,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s got to shake up the pack, it\u2019s fundamental \u2013 he\u2019s got to change the attitude at the top. There\u2019s too much Mr Nice Guy \u2013 he\u2019s not prepared to tackle the difficult issues such as immigration. \u2018People at the top of the Labour Party need to listen to concerns over immigration and over people\u2019s feeling of being disenfranchised in England. What I want is Ed Miliband to listen to the concerns of people like me and voters I represent. \u2018In order to win he needs a bigger dose of Northern realism.\u2019 Labour\u2019s former Scottish leader Henry McLeish said that Mr Miliband had made \u2018elementary\u2019 mistakes. \u2018What is the vision?

        "article": "Philadelphia (CNN) -- Longtime Philadelphia Daily News sports columnist Bill Conlin will not face prosecution over child sex abuse allegations -- even if there were grounds for charges -- because the statute of limitations concerning the alleged crimes has expired, according to prosecutors. The claims were published in an article by The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday after an investigation was initiated by authorities, according to a statement from Bernard Weisenfeld, a spokesman for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey. The article says three women and a man allege they were molested by Conlin in the 1970s when they were between the ages of 7 and 12. One of the alleged victims is Conlin's niece, said Slade McLaughlin, an attorney who represents three of the accusers. A spokesman for the Daily News said the newspaper had no knowledge of the allegations prior to The Inquirer's story. Conlin has denied the claims, speaking through his attorney. He retired from the Daily News on Tuesday, the newspaper said. \"Mr. Conlin is obviously floored by these allegations, which supposedly happened 40 years ago. He's engaged me to do everything possible to bring the facts forward to vindicate his name,\" said attorney George Bochetto. Prosecutors say an exhaustive investigation had been launched into the allegations. But, Weisenfeld said, it was later determined that even if there were legal grounds to pursue a criminal prosecution, prosecutors are barred from doing so because the alleged crimes occurred too long ago. A 1996 law actually eliminates statutes of limitations on sexual assault cases in New Jersey, but the law is not considered retroactive for claims that date back as far as the 1970s. Still, McLaughlin said, his clients want to speak out. \"They made the decision that they were going to tell their story,\" the attorney told CNN. \"This isn't a he-said, she-said story. It's a he-said, they-said. Their only motives are getting closure and public service.\" McLaughlin also noted, after speaking with his clients, that the accusations made in The Inquirer's story were accurate. Conlin, 77, who gained national recognition from appearances on ESPN, could not be immediately reached for comment. The veteran sportswriter worked for the Daily News for nearly half a century. The newspaper published an editorial Wednesday written by its managing editor in an effort to address the scandal. \"I have been a journalist for more than a quarter century, and I have never had a professional experience that was sadder \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or more shocking \u00e2\u20ac\u201d than reading the allegations leveled against Bill Conlin yesterday,\" wrote Larry Platt. \"We've taken the unusual step of also running (the Inquirer's story), in its entirety, on the following page, because I felt you deserved to see the allegations in full context,\" he added. Still, Platt reminded readers that Conlin has not been charged with a crime. The Inquirer and the Daily News are owned by a parent company, Philadelphia Media Network. This week's allegations come in the wake of a series of recent child sex abuse scandals, including the case against former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts of child sex abuse spread over several years. Conlin, who covered sports throughout Pennsylvania for the newspaper, weighed in on the Penn State scandal last month in a column published by the Daily News titled \"Tough Guys Are Talking About Sandusky.\" Conlin expressed doubt about those who said they would have intervened on behalf of a child, had they witnessed the boy's alleged molestation at the hands of Sandusky in a university locker room shower. \"Everybody says he will do the right thing, get involved, put his own ass on the line before or after the fact,\" Conlin wrote in a column published on November 11. \"But the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending our fearless intentions.\"",

Alonso is heading for McLaren, the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, with Vettel ending his stay at Red Bull. Vettel, the four-time world champion, will team up with Kimi Raikkonen at the Prancing Horse. He will earn about \u00a350million a year as the highest-paid driver in history. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sebastian Vettel showing off in the desert . Sebastian Vettel, pictured in the Abu Dhabi paddock on Thursday, has signed a three-year deal with Ferrari . Vettel enjoyed a successful relationship with Red Bull, winning four world titles with the Milton Keynes team . Vettel and Fernando Alonso are sat alongside each other at the press conference ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP . 'The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true,' Vettel said. 'When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it\u2019s an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. 'I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. 'The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.' The two announcements have been the worst-kept secrets in Formula One. Whilst there has been no confirmation from Alonso as to his future plans, it is understood he has already agreed a deal to return to McLaren which will be announced in December. The team are still mulling over whether Jenson Button or Kevin Magnussen will partner Alonso from 2015. Vettel celebrates his fourth world title on the pit straight at the Indian Grand Prix in October 2013 . Alonso leaves after five years at Ferrari - here he is pictured celebrating his last win at the 2013 Spanish GP . Double world champion Alonso flies the Ferrari flag after winning the Chinese Grand Prix in 2013 . For Alonso, it is the end of his five-year relationship with the team which ultimately has failed to yield the third world title he long believed would be his in switching allegiance to the Maranello marque. The Spaniard did finish runner-up on three occasions, missing out by four points in 2010 and just three in 2012, whilst he was a long way adrift last season, with Vettel champion on each occasion. Instead, Alonso leaves with only 11 victories to his name, the last of which was on home soil in Spain last season, as well as another 33 podiums. Since Red Bull's announcement of Vettel's departure seven weeks ago, Alonso has since played games with the media when quizzed on his future plans. Although apparently knowing where he is heading, the 33-year-old still conceded leaving Ferrari was tough. Alonso is expected to replace 2009 world champion Jenson Button at McLaren next season . Alonso said: 'Today is not an easy one for me, because even if I always look to the future with great enthusiasm and determination, at the end of this season my journey as a Ferrari driver will come to an end. 'It was a difficult decision to take, but a carefully considered one, and from start to finish, my love for Ferrari was a prime consideration. 'I have always been lucky enough to make my own decisions about my future and I have that possibility now too. 'I must thank the team for that, as it understood my position. 'I leave Scuderia Ferrari after five years, during which I reached my very best level professionally, tackling major challenges that pushed me to find new limits. I also proved to be a true team player, putting the interests of the Scuderia before my own. Michael Schumacher won five world championships with Ferrari at the turn of the century . Schumacher is presented with a trophy by football legend Pele ahead of the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix . 'When I had to take important decisions about my future, I did so with Ferrari in my heart, driven by my love for the team. 'I am very proud of what we have achieved together. Thanks to the efforts of the men and women of Maranello, on three occasions we came second in the Formula One world championship, two of them fighting for the title right up to and including the final race, running in a championship winning position for many laps. 'Without a shadow of a doubt, these five years produced some of the best moments of my career. 'I also feel that, in leaving the team, it is family rather than friends I am leaving behind. 'Now I look to the future with great enthusiasm, knowing that part of my heart will always belong to the Prancing Horse. 'I want to thank each and everyone of the team for the trust they showed in me.' VIDEO Schumacher is paralysed but improving - Streiff .",

        "article": "By . Stephen Wright and Ryan Kisiel . Last updated at 12:57 AM on 14th December 2011 . One of the men accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. In an appalling racist rant recorded by a police surveillance camera, David Norris boasted he would use \u2018two sub-machine guns\u2019 in a plan to \u2018skin a black ****\u2019 and \u2018blow their two arms and legs off\u2019. Then, he said, he would tell them: \u2018Go on, you can swim home now\u2019. He added: \u2018They would be bobbing about like that.\u2019 Suspects: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris both deny murder . Norris, 35, and Gary Dobson, 36, are alleged to have fatally stabbed 18-year-old Stephen, an A-level student, in Eltham, South East London, in April 1993. Twenty months later, in December 1994, police installed a covert camera inside Dobson\u2019s rented flat in Footscray Road, Eltham. Over a period of 17 days, detectives heard Dobson frequently use racist terms to describe black and Asian people, jurors were told. Dobson was seen in one video clip recalling a time when he threatened a black colleague with a knife. A brawl started between the pair when Dobson stole his baseball cap, and he later threatened the colleague with a Stanley knife. Dobson said on the video: \u2018I said, \u201cTap me once more, you silly **** , I\u2019m going to slice this down you seven times\u201d.\u2019 He was also seen wandering around the flat with a large knife, and telling another man who is not on trial, Neil Acourt, that a \u2018Paki\u2019 had won the lottery jackpot. On one occasion, Acourt was seen to hide a knife in his jacket before leaving the flat with Norris.Before . jurors were shown a series of clips from the surveillance video, the . trial judge Mr Justice Treacy warned they might find the material . distressing. \u2018The material . you will be watching shows the behaviour the prosecution alleges is . racist and violent but you will have to be the judges of what it shows,\u2019 he told them. \u2018You may well find it shocking. If you do, you must remember that emotion has no part to play in this trial.\u2019 The black and white sequences were shot over a number of days on a tiny camera installed low in the front room of the flat, close to the television. Murdered: Black teenager Stephen Lawrence who was stabbed to death in April 1992 . The conversations between Dobson, . Norris and Acourt were heard with programmes such as Coronation Street, . News at Ten and Gladiators in the background. Stephen . was stabbed to death in Well Hall Road, Eltham, shortly after 10.30pm . on April 22 1993, after being attacked by a gang of white youths who had . shouted racist abuse. Detectives asked Dobson about his grey bomber jacket which prosecutors say is now at the heart of the case. Dobson said: \u2018Neither me or my jacket was out that night, the night of the murder.\u2019 He went on: \u2018Stabbing innocent people is not something we get off on, it\u2019s not something we enjoy doing .\u2009.\u2009. we\u2019re not animals.\u2019 The court has previously heard that brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt were suspects in the original investigation and items of clothing were seized from their family home in Eltham during a police search. Dobson and Norris were charged after a forensic breakthrough during a review of the case in 2007 and 2008. Prosecutors claim that 16 fibres linked to the clothes Stephen wore on the night of his death were found on Dobson\u2019s jacket and a multi-coloured cardigan, or in the evidence bags they were kept in.Scientists also found a tiny blood stain on the collar of his jacket and a fragment of blood which encased two fibres. Defence lawyers claim that neither Norris nor Dobson was at the scene at the time of the killing and have suggested forensic evidence has been contaminated. At the time of the killing Dobson was living in Eltham, and Norris lived three miles away in Chislehurst. Dobson later rented the flat in Footscray Road with a friend. Dobson and Norris deny murder. The trial continues. They were separated by nearly two decades \u2013 the foul-mouthed teenager with a knife in his hand, and the sober-suited, quietly spoken man in the witness box. One was Gary Dobson aged 19, filmed on a secret police camera the year after Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death. The other was Gary Dobson aged 36, facing a murder charge 17 years later. Yesterday an Old Bailey jury saw both of them \u2013 first when the 1994 video recording turned the clock back to the time when he and his associates were suspects; then when he took the witness stand to deny any involvement in killing the 18-year-old black student. For the first time in this marathon trial, jurors witnessed the venom and racial hatred that was captured by a covert camera set up in Dobson\u2019s rented flat. His friend David Norris, now his co-defendant, was heard bragging that he wanted to torture and kill black people. Dobson and one of his friends were seen holding large knives. But yesterday Dobson, sitting just yards from Stephen\u2019s parents in court, said he was \u2018disgusted and embarrassed\u2019 by the racist language he was heard using on the covert film. He conceded there was \u2018no denying\u2019 he held racist views at the time it was made, but he added: \u2018I don\u2019t dislike people because of the colour of their skin.\u2019 He said he had black, Asian and Chinese friends. The stark contrast between the 1994 film and the figure in the witness box came on the first day of the defence case after nearly a month of prosecution evidence. It was the first time the court has heard either defendant speak, save for answering to their names on day one \u2013 the first time, too, that either has been out of the dock. Earlier Dobson had sat in silence as the film was played to the court. Now he adjusted his striped blue tie, pulled down the waistcoat of his three-piece suit and sat facing the eight men and four women jurors. Above him, in the public gallery, his mother and relatives watched. A dark-haired woman was in tears. Asked by his counsel Timothy Roberts QC how he felt as he watched the film, Dobson replied: \u2018To be honest with you, I\u2019m not comfortable sitting there watching it. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it in 15 years. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. It\u2019s certainly not the way I was brought up to speak either.\u2019 When he was filmed talking to his friend Neil Acourt about threatening to \u2018slice\u2019 a black workmate with a Stanley knife, it was \u2018just a bit of bravado\u2019, he said. \u2018I think I was just talking up the situation and relating it to my friends .\u2009.\u2009. just being a bit stupid.\u2019 Why did the surveillance film at his flat show him at one stage with a knife in his hand? \u2018I can\u2019t quite recall, but watching the video, I\u2019d been cleaning and tidying up and everything else .\u2009.\u2009. there\u2019s a chance I was making dinner at that time.\u2019 What did he feel about being heard to call someone a Paki? \u2018It\u2019s not right,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t defend it. I can\u2019t justify it.\u2019 He would \u2018definitely not\u2019 have used that sort of language in front of his parents, he said. And calling someone on TV a n***** ? \u2018I suppose you could call it idiotic banter,\u2019 he said, \u2018.\u2009.\u2009. for the amusement of my friends sitting there with me. It was just a rude and stupid conversation.\u2019 Dobson was adamant he was at home with his parents on the night of April 22, 1993, when Stephen was attacked by a gang of white youths at around 10.30pm. Dobson had been in his bedroom listening to music and playing computer games, he told the jury. The only time he went out was some time around 11.30pm, when he called at the home of his friends Neil and Jamie Acourt, who, the court has been told, later became suspects in the police investigation. He went to borrow a Bob Marley CD and ask if they had a joint for him to smoke. Wasn\u2019t that rather late to be making a social call, his barrister asked? \u2018It was,\u2019 he agreed. \u2018But at that age in life, for me and all my group of friends, it wasn\u2019t too unusual to be going round late at night.\u2019 Mr Roberts asked him: \u2018Did you have anything to do with the events that led to the death of Stephen Lawrence? \u2018No,\u2019 Dobson replied. \u2018I did not.\u2019",

Last night, a spokesman for leading drugs charity Cranstoun condemned the firm's 'trivialisation' of methamphetamine, which can lead to severe paranoia, lesions, hallucinations and even death. She told The Sun: 'Trivialising this drug is ultimately irresponsible as it takes one further step towards normalising what can be catastrophic substance use.'

The multi award-winning drama follows the life of chemistry teacher Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, who, after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, starts making crystal meth to secure his family's future. Firebox has refused to comment. Methamphetamine - often referred to as 'crystal meth' - is a highly addictive drug that stimulates the brain and nervous system. It is Class A drug - with those in possession of it risking up to seven years in jail and/or an unlimited fine. Supplying the substance can result in life imprisonment. Even in small doses, methamphetamine can increase wakefulness and physical activity, while decreasing appetite. Illegal: Class A drug methamphetamine - or 'crystal meth' - is one of the world's most addictive substances .

A 14-year-old girl was repeatedly raped at a drug den by a gang of men who treated her with 'indignity and contempt', a jury has heard. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to the house in Brierfield, Lancashire, and allegedly passed around for their sexual gratification. The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service. A girl, 14, was taken to a house in Brierfield, Lancashire, and . allegedly passed around for the sexual gratification of a gang of men. Omar Mazafar (left), 21, denies aiding and abetting rape; Mohammed Zishan Amjad (centre), 24, and Haroon Mahmood (right), 22, deny rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child . Mohammed Suleman Farooq (left), 22, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation. Also pictured are Omar Mazafar (centre) and Mohammed Zishan Amjad, arriving at Burnley Crown Court . He befriended the girl when she was 12 or 13 and frequently took her for drives in his cars, it is alleged. Prosecutor Alaric Bassano told Burnley Crown Court: 'It was him who took her on many occasions to the house and him who assisted, encouraged and incited others to rape and sexually assault this girl. 'On one occasion, he raped the girl himself. Over a period of time he subdued her will and coerced her into submission.' He said three other men raped her and one man subjected her to a sexual assault. The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated. She could be aggressive, disobedient towards her mother, refusing to go to school and staying out late at night, he added. The girl told police that her mobile telephone number was given to Imran Amjad, known to her as 'Immy', by another, and he called to ask to meet up. Three of the defendants are seen leaving Burnley Crown Court yesterday. The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated . She first met up with him when she was aged 13 and was driven around the streets of Burnley in his car every few days, she said. Her mother became concerned she spent so much time in his company and confronted him. Mr Bassano said the defendant\u2019s response typified his 'arrogance', which he said would emerge in the trial. He said: 'When she told him about her age, and when she advanced her accusation that he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with her, he simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away. 'It is to be noted that he did not deny the allegation.' Her mother contacted the police in . December 2009 to report her concerns about her daughter\u2019s welfare at the . hands of 'Immy', he said. Mr Bassano said the girl made no complaint at the time and continued to mix with Immy who, undeterred, went on to commit the numerous offences against her in 2010. All six defendants are from Brierfield. Imran Amjad denies abducting a child, rape, engaging in sexual activity with a child, aiding and abetting rape, and witness intimidation. He is also accused of intentionally encouraging or assisting the rape of the girl by a man known as 'Saj'. The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service. Above, four of the defendants pictured yesterday . Haroon Mahmood, 22, denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child. Mohammed Zishan Amjad, 24, also denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child. Mohammed Suleman Farooq, 22, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation. Shiraz Afzal, 25, and Omar Mazafar, 21, both deny aiding and abetting rape. All the sexual offences are said to have been committed between April and October 2010. In summary, Mr Bassano said: 'This case concerns the sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old girl. A number of men were involved in this abuse which involved planning and, on occasions, offenders acting together. 'The girl was groomed over a period of time and on many occasions she was taken to a house in Brierfield. 'That house was used as a den at which young men attended and brought or invited girls and young women in order to drink alcohol, take drugs and engage in sex. 'It was to this house that the girl was taken and at this house where she was sexually assaulted and raped by several adult males. 'During these times the girl was being passed between the men to be used for their own sexual gratification. The Crown contends that this girl was treated with indignity and contempt by them. 'All six defendants were involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in this sexual abuse.' The trial, expected to last six weeks, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- One week ago, the chief of Pakistan's Army Staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, told graduating cadets in the city of Abbottabad that the \"back of terrorism\" in Pakistan had been broken, thanks to the sacrifices of Pakistan's soldiers. Kayani was speaking at the \"passing out parade\" at the prestigious Kakul military academy in Abbottabad, the West Point of Pakistan. At that very moment, the man who had dragged Pakistan into the \"War on Terror\" a decade earlier was, it transpires, just a mile or two away, living in apparent comfort behind the high walls of a very private compound. Osama bin Laden, who had declared war on Pakistan, had apparently been living for months in a city that had made its name as a military garrison. Abbottabad, pronounced AHB-tah-bahd, is some 60 miles by winding mountainous roads north of Pakistan's capital. Surrounded by green hills, it is renowned for its trees and parks. It's a popular retirement place for officers in the Pakistani army, partly because of its military academy, but also because of its agreeable climate. During British rule, the Imperial Gazeteer of India described it as \"picturesquely situated,\" 4,120 feet above sea level. Abbottabad sits on the Karakoram Highway, an engineering marvel that links Pakistan with China through the Himalayas. Before much of Pakistan became off-limits to most foreign tourists, it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the Swat valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. But despite its military traditions, its hockey fields and golf courses, Abbottabad and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to al Qaeda and other extremist groups. In January this year, Pakistani security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized Umar Patek, an Indonesian linked to al Qaeda who had a $1 million bounty on his head under the FBI's Rewards for Justice program. He had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in Bali that killed 200 people. Patek -- a key leader in the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in Abbottabad after arriving in Pakistan some months earlier on a forged visa. He is now being held (after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest) pending a decision on his extradition. Patek's arrest followed that of a Pakistani in Abbottabad called Tahir Shehzad, an alleged al Qaeda facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time, according to Pakistani media reports. Shehzad had allegedly gone to Lahore to meet two French militants who were planning to travel to North Waziristan with Patek. So Abbottabad emerges as something of a way station for al Qaeda and associated groups. Geographically, that makes sense. As the crow flies, the city is just over 100 miles from the border with Kunar province in Afghanistan, an area where al Qaeda has kept a foothold since 9/11. Even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between, the journey can be completed in a day. It is even closer to the restive tribal territories. In the past two years, the Pakistani army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the Pakistani Taliban, rather than chasing down the remnants of al Qaeda or launching the offensive against militants in North Waziristan that Washington has long demanded. The area to the north of Abbottabad saw a surge in Taliban activity two years ago, as the Taliban sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border Afghanistan into what was North West Frontier Province, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The town of Buner, just 30 miles from Abbottabad and 60 miles from Islamabad, fell to the Taliban early in 2009. They also established a training camp close to the town of Mansehr, a few miles from Abbottabad. The Pakistani military has since gradually reasserted control over the area, expelling the Taliban from the Swat Valley, but at a bloody cost. Clashes continue sporadically in the area, and an attack on the offices of the charity World Vision last year in Mansehr resulted in six of the non-governmental organization's workers being shot dead. To the east of Abbottabad is Pakistani Kashmir, its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to \"liberating\" Indian Kashmir. So it is a city close to the front lines of several of South Asia's insurgencies and terror campaigns. Like much of the region, Abbottabad has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry. Back in the mid-19th century a British officer named Maj. James Abbott brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its Sikh and Muslim populations. Abbott's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him. He even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name: . \"I remember the day when I first came here . And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air ...\"",

A Tuesday meeting of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, left, and Dmitry Medvedev has angered Iranian-Americans. The demonstration came in the wake of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev hosting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Moscow on Tuesday, despite allegations of ballot fraud in Ahmadinejad's re-election last week. \"We're hoping that the world attention does not end from what the Iranians are doing right now, because this is not going to end in the next few days, because this is a long haul, a long battle,\" said Washington protest and group organizer Morteza Ahmady. \"Iranians are very capable of deciding their own destiny.\" The group Whereismyvote.org organized the demonstration of about 100 people and aims to build support for its \"global protest\" this Saturday. \"I think it's a very new thing from a historical point of view; it's a civic movement. People try to keep it as nonviolent and civil as possible,\" said group organizer Negar Mortarzavi. In Russia, Ahmadinejad was welcomed as the \"newly re-elected president of Iran,\" with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov telling reporters, \"the issue of elections in Iran is an internal affair of the Iranian people.\" Eighty-five percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters went to the polls on Friday, an unprecedented turnout, Iran's interior ministry said. When the ballots were counted, the government declared Ahmadinejad the winner, with 62.63 percent of the vote. The man many analysts had widely expected to win, Mir Hossein Moussavi, received 33.75 percent. The speed with which the election results were released -- two hours after polls closed -- insulted the Iranian people, said Ahmady, who cited that as a sign of fraud. Moussavi's camp has demanded new elections. Sarah, a Washington protester who would give only her first name, agreed. \"We're not saying that pro-Ahmadinejad supporters don't exist; they do exist,\" she said. \"And we're saying that, yes, if they indeed did win the vote, then the election should be theirs, because we are a democratic people.

Controversial: Government expert David Norgrove, pictured, says that grandparents do 'damage' children during divorce cases . Badly behaved grandparents 'damage' children because they interfere in divorces and ramp up conflict between couples, it was claimed today. Acrimonious couples also use their parents as 'weapons' to get one over their partners as they break-up, according to the Government's legal advisor on families. David Norgrove has been leading a review on family law and said while he accepted that grandparents are often 'extremely important in a child\u2019s life' they can be demanding when it comes to access to their grandchildren. He says this can mean that children do not always come first in a bitter divorce, hurting the innocent youngsters involved. 'Grandparents can be used by parents as a way of getting at their ex-partner. Grandparents are not always straightforward in the way they behave and the result can be damage to children,' he said. 'Not all grandparents are good grandparents. One of the separating parents can use his or her parents as a weapon against the other partner. 'We should not be putting all the emphasis on the rights of the adults. The question is wrong: it should be what is in the best interests of the child, not what is right for the adults.' Controversially his review has dashed fathers\u2019 hopes of securing equal rights to share custody of their children in the event of a split. He also rejected any claims that Grandparents also do badly after a divorce saying they must still go through the courts over access to children. Interfering: Grandparents are also used as 'weapons' in break-ups while children are left to suffer, it has been claimed . 'There is no evidence that courts unreasonably refuse the ability of a grandparent to bring an application for contact with their grandchildren,' Mr Norgrove said. A new DIY system is being proposed to speed up divorces away from court. The 'divorce information hub' would be online with a step-by-step guide showing how to end a marriage legally as well as set up maintenance and access arrangements for children. The new report suggests this route is the best way to keep parents and their children out of the courts. New parenting agreements will help decide where the child will live and also how much contact the other parent will have. The plan will mean that couples will only go to court as a last resort if the process above fails and they cannot agree. But critics say that the Tory-ordered report does not follow through on their promises for equal rights for all family in child-access arrangements. James Deuchars, of Grandparents Apart UK, said: \u2018The Tories said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights. This is a betrayal of that promise. It was all a con and a gimmick.' Mr Norgrove's 220-page review has been denounced as a \u2018betrayal\u2019 of the family as mothers still have more rights. Ken Sanderson, chief executive of Families Need Fathers, said the review's failure to recommend shared parenting legislation or a statement on the importance of both parents in law represents 'an abdication of their responsibilities to children and their families'. 'The core failing of the current family justice system is that the rights of children to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, are not adequately supported or enforced,' he said. Nadine O'Connor, campaign director of Fathers 4 Justice, added that the review was 'a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice.' Sham: David Cameron's Government has been accused of reneging on promises made before the last General Election . The review called for parents to be encouraged to develop a parenting agreement 'to set out arrangements for the care of their children post-separation' to help eliminate disputes over contact and where the child should live. Mr Norgrove's report is also suggesting that more parents should spend less time in . court instead using 'do it yourself' websites where divorce forms can be . downloaded. The online process would force the couple into mediation before being put in front of a judge as a last resort. 'At the moment it is very hard to get hold of the forms. The aim is to . make it easier for people to do it themselves because the tendency is . for it all to get out of control,' he said. The report also called for the Government to develop a child arrangements order, which would set out plans for the upbringing of a child when a court is required to get involved. These orders should also be available to grandparents and wider family members with the permission of the court. The review also called for the duration of court cases to be restricted to six months - instead of the average 13 months now. Mr Norgrove said that making children wait well over a year for their futures to be settled was 'shocking'. 'This is why we are recommending legislation to ensure that child protection cases must not be allowed to take any more than six months, save in exceptional circumstances,' he said. He added: 'Every year 500,000 children and adults are involved in the family justice system. They turn to it at times of great stress and conflict. 'It must deliver the best possible outcome for all the children and families who use it, because its decisions directly affect the lives and futures of all those involved, and have repercussions for society as a whole.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has hailed ending the Champions League reign of Barcelona as the greatest moment of his controversial career, but said he could now never return to his former club. Mourinho has had a fractious relationship with the Spanish champions since ending his four-year tenure on the coaching staff in 2000, and stoked the tensions ahead of Wednesday night's second leg of the semifinal in the Catalan capital. The Portuguese accused Barca of being obsessed with reaching the May 22 final because it will be held at the home of their bitter rivals Real Madrid, and his joyous on-pitch celebrations at the Nou Camp after Inter prevailed 3-2 on aggregate further incensed home fans. \"I'm not stupid enough to think that this hate can be turned into love,\" he told reporters. \"I respect Barca and and I'll never forget what the club gave me in the four years I was here, but something has been created around me that is hard to make positive. \"It is clear that I will end my career without having coached Barca.\" Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? Mourinho has already won Europe's premier club competition with Porto in 2004, and took English side Chelsea to two semifinals -- facing Barcelona on six occasions in often highly-charged encounters. But he said that leading Italian champions Inter to a first European Cup final since 1972 -- with German giants Bayern Munich now in the way of the Nerazzuri's first title in 45 years -- was the best achievement of his career. \"For the players, me, the fans, it's the greatest. We were a team of heroes. We sweated blood,\" Mourinho said after Inter lost 1-0 on the night, hanging on despite playing for an hour with only 10 men following the sending-off of former Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta. \"It's been 38 years since Inter played in the final. This is not a team of young players who can wait 15 years to make the final -- they will not have another 10 opportunities to play in one,\" Mourinho added. \"Against Barcelona it's difficult with 11 players, but with 10 it's an historic achievement to win like this. It's the most beautiful defeat of my life.\" Mourinho is targeting a hat-trick of trophies this season, with Inter leading the Serie A title race by one point with three matches to play and also having secure a place in the Italian Cup final -- with Roma the chief rival in both competitions. \"We have five games left in all competitions. Tonight we will party, tomorrow we will sleep and after that prepare to face Lazio on Sunday,\" he said. \"I ask the fans for another favor -- come to Milan airport and welcome this splendid team home. Come to Rome on Sunday for the game with Lazio and then come to the Italian Cup final next Wednesday.\" Mourinho has had a difficult time with the Italian press since replacing Roberto Mancini at the San Siro in 2008, but said he had a close bond with his club. \"I was close to the fans when I was at Chelsea, but I am even closer to the Inter fans. I love Inter and the supporters, but not Italian football. I respect it, but I don't love it,\" he said. \"I thank everyone who played and who did not play. I thank all the fans, those who were here and those who remained at home. Absolutely incredible things happened.\" Barcelona will now turn their attention to retaining the Spanish league title, as Josep Guardiola's team lead Real by a point with four matches to play. \"We lost to a great team and a great coach, but we want to win the league and we will be back -- I have nothing to reproach my players for,\" the coach said ahead of Saturday's trip to sixth-placed Villarreal.",

        "article": "By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . The dream home of a respected architect hangs in the balance today as a judge decides whether it is too modern for its historic neighborhood and should be torn down. Attorneys for architect\u00a0Louis Cherry and his wife Marsha Gordon, along with a council board backed by some of their neighbors, presented closing arguments to Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan on Tuesday. Mr Cherry had been given approval to build their sleek two-story home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina almost a year ago. However six months into the project, the council revoked their permission after complaints that the design was ruining the look of the surrounding area. Scroll down for video . Architect Louis Cherry and his wife, Marsha Gordon, stand in front of their home in the Historic Oakwood neighborhood of Raleigh, N.C. in March. A decision on whether the couple may have to demolish the unfinished home because of a neighbor's challenge that it doesn't meet guidelines for the historic district is expected shortly . A sign in front of a Victorian home marks the boundary of the Historic Oakwood District in Raleigh, N.C. The clash over whether a modern house under construction fits in with its older neighbors may finally be over after a judge heard closing arguments on Tuesday . The final word rests with\u00a0Superior Court Judge Elaine Bushfan. It is not clear when her decision will be made but when it comes, it will be the end of months of bitter fighting in the moneyed streets. If the judge favors the Historic Development Commission, Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon can complete their unfinished home, according to\u00a0newsobserver.com. However if she upholds the Board of Adjustment\u2019s later reversal of that decision, the house will be torn down. The couple have been unable to continue with the project, and money that could have been spent on finishing their dream home was swallowed up by legal fees. 'It was very much our intention to design and build a house that people would really like and accept,' Mr Cherry, who had already dug the foundation and spent more than $100,000 on building materials, said earlier this year. 'It was very surprising to us that there's been this reaction, as if this is some crazy, modernist intervention.' This  inside of the home at 516 Euclid Street which is facing demolition after neighbors complained about its appearance . The home has an open-plan design in keeping with its modern, minimal values. It could be worth $500,000 on completion... if a judge allows it . Mr Cherry's dream home (pictured here) is under threat after town planners in Raleigh, North Carolina said its design was too radically different from the surrounding neighborhood . Out of options: Nearly six months into construction, with the home roughly finished, Mr Cherry and wife Marsha Gordon faced the possibility that they might have to tear down their dream house . The dispute began last September, when the Raleigh Historic Development Commission issued a certificate of appropriateness, or COA, for the proposed 2,100sq ft house. A few days later, Gail Wiesner, who lives across the street, filed a notice of intent to appeal against the house, that could be valued at as much as $500,000 when finished. But Mr Cherry and Ms Gordon proceeded with construction, saying the city advised them the appeal was merely 'procedural'. Ms Wiesner, a real estate agent, argued that the commission's COA-panel violated several procedures. She called the design 'garishly inappropriate' and said the couple had 'failed to meet their burden of producing competent, material, and substantial testimony and evidence to show that their proposed project preserves the special character of the Oakwood Historic District'. 'The structure as proposed is incongruous to the Oakwood Historic District,' Ms Wiesner, whose home was built in 2008, wrote. 'It will harm the character of the neighborhood and contribute to erosion of the neighborhood's value as an asset to its residents, to the surrounding communities, to the businesses it supports, to in-town and out-of-town visitors, and to the city as a whole.' Oakwood is an eclectic mix of 19th and early 20th century architectural styles - from ornate Italianate mansions and mansard-roofed Victorians, to quaint bungalows and brightly-painted shotgun houses. Houses in the area sell for about $450,000 and the historic district was created in the 1970s, when residents banded together to stop a proposed highway that would have cut through its center. Although Mr Cherry has built a career out of modern architecture, he says his Oakwood home was sympathetic to the surrounding neighborhood, and was simple in design. 'Cherry\u2019s house is an example of modern architecture trying hard, very hard, to be on its best manners - in essence, to be a good neighbor,' Vanity Fair reported. September 2013: The subcommittee of the Raleigh Historic Development Commission votes 3-1 to approve Louis Cherry and Marsha Gordon's new build. The commission, which is appointed by the Raleigh City Council is supposed to judge whether new homes meet the historical guidelines architecturally. Construction started in October 2013. February 2014: Neighbor Gail Wiesner appeals to the Board of Adjustment and it votes 3-2 to revoke the approval for the house. Their justification is that the commission failed in their duty to apply the proper guidelines. The secretive board usually handles permits for day-care centers and minor city code violations. August 2014: If Cherry and Gordon do not win their appeal - their $500,000 home will be torn down. In February, the city's Board of Adjustment voted 3-2 to overturn the certificate of appropriateness. The panel sent word to city hall to issue a 'stop work' order. Word soon spread beyond Oakwood's borders. In early March, Oakwood Modern House\u00a0launched its own Twitter account, which has more than 2,000 followers. Its raison d'etre reads: 'I'm a modern house fighting for my life in a Victorian neighborhood.' 'Nails hurt. But no love hurts worse,' one tweet read. 'Why does that ugly green house keep staring at me? Stop it,' another said, in reference to Ms Wiesner's home. More recently messages have become even snarkier. 'You'd think neighbors would have something better to do than complain about me, but I guess thinking doesn't always get you far in Oakwood,' one tweet read. 'In the future, every house will be famous for 15 minutes,' another reads. 'I like big [moving] trucks and I cannot lie', it went on, along with: 'I would use this courtroom recess to take a bathroom break, but indoor plumbing is a modern infrastructure yet to be approved in Oakwood.' Will Hillebrenner, an engineer who has been restoring his First World War-era bungalow, is one of many Oakwood residents who believe the historic development commission failed to stick to its own standards. 'The guidelines clearly state that any home, any new construction in the historic district should blend in and not stand out,' he said. 'And a home whose very intent is a living piece of art is intended to stand out.' Many of the architect's neighbors have complained because they feel his modern home does not sit well with their period homes . This is one of the homes directly opposite the Oakwood Modern House designed by Louis Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina . Mary Iverson, who owns four historic homes in the neighborhood, says the Cherry house is beautiful, but it doesn't belong in Oakwood. 'That is a leap of 100 years of design architecture,' she said. 'So that's not an evolution. That's a, ''So let's go to another planet.''' Gene Conti, whose 1875 Victorian was in the path of the proposed highway, likes the modern house but hates what this fight is doing to Oakwood. 'I think it's been unfortunate ... to have this kind of acrimony all across the neighborhood and have people arguing one side or the other in a very mean-spirited way,' he said. 'Oakwood is a historic neighborhood by designation. But it doesn't mean all the houses are frozen in time.' Ms Gordon and Mr Cherry said that what is happening to them is a violation of Oakwood's spirit. 'You can't build an old home,' Louis Cherry said. 'Forty years of preservation wisdom show that building copycat homes diminishes the value of historic homes. It doesn't really honor them.' 'And it creates a Disneyland kind of community, which is not what Oakwood is,' Ms Gordon said. Oakwood Modern House Twitter account was set up in defense of the modern home and now has more than 2,000 followers . The posts have become snarkier as the neighborhood gripes gathered steam over the past year ending up in a courtroom battle .",

Bookies believe tennis star Andy Murray has asked girlfriend Kim Sears to marry him - or is just about to - after a flurry of betting on him popping the question at Wimbledon. Tennis fans have been betting heavily on the Scottish champion to both retain his title and get engaged at 8/1 with bookmaker William Hill, which eventually stopped taking bets on it.

        "article": "(OPRAH.com) -- Decision-making can be challenging for anyone, but when a couple needs to make a collective decision, the challenge becomes greater, psychologist Dr. Josh Klapow says. Remind your partner that you are a team and collaboration is needed when facing differing opinions. The key is to recognize that the decision-making process is the same regardless of the type of decision, Dr. Klapow says. \"Making decisions as a couple is not so much about what you decide on, but rather how you go about the process of making the decision,\" he says. \"If you approach each decision with the same game plan, then over time, you will become experts at decision-making.\" Dr. Klapow shares his five \"smart\" (set, monitor, arrange, recruit and treat) steps to collective decision-making. Set a specific goal . Make sure you are very specific about what you want, Dr. Klapow says. For example, a goal of saving money is not specific enough; however, saying that you want to save an extra $100 per month by automatic deduction from your paychecks to pay off your credit card is specific. \"The more specific you are, the better,\" he says. Monitor your discussion . As you are discussing the decision at hand, make sure you are staying on track, Dr. Klapow says. \"Very often couples will start discussing a goal and stray to some other topic, which can lead to frustration,\" he says. \"If you notice yourself or your spouse getting off the subject, quickly come back to the specific goal.\" Oprah.com: The five best things to do for your relationship . Arrange the situation for success . Decision-making doesn't work well when someone is tired, hungry, short of time or preoccupied with other activities. \"Before you start the discussion, make sure each of you is in the right frame of mind and you have the time,\" Dr. Klapow says. If not, take a break from the discussion because it likely won't be productive. Recruit support from one another . A collective decision means that sometimes there will be a compromise, Dr. Klapow says. If you are going into the discussion to win, then you are not making a collective decision -- you are fighting a battle, he says. \"Remind each other that you are a team and that you are in it to win collectively, not necessarily individually,\" he says. Treat yourselves . Because decision-making can be one of the toughest challenges a couple faces, celebrate the success of a decision together. \"A hug, a celebratory reward -- anything that acknowledges that together you have accomplished this task -- will help keep you motivated to make decisions together again,\" Dr. Klapow says.

A group of former MPs and VIPs are alleged to have sexually abused children and killed three boys in the Seventies and Eighties. But yesterday Mrs May suggested even worse claims would follow as she said it was crucial for society to \u2018get the truth\u2019. Scroll down for video . Theresa May (pictured) suggested worse claims would follow and it is crucial for society to \u2018get the truth' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe insisted Scotland Yard was taking the claims seriously and promised there would be no cover-up. Last night, Labour MP John Mann said: \u2018It would now be extraordinary if there are not arrests soon of prominent people.\u2019 Mrs May said she was determined to ensure that the issues were fully investigated, telling the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u2018How was it that in the past, but continuing today, the very institutions of the state that should be protecting children were not doing so? \u2018Why was it that these abuses were able to take place and that nobody was brought to justice as a result of that? \u2018We must as a society, I believe, get to the truth of that and because I think what we\u2019re seeing is... only the tip of the iceberg on this issue.\u2019 Sir Bernard said dozens of detectives were investigating the historic Westminster child abuse allegations, adding: \u2018We have 40 detectives looking into these relatively new claims. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured right) also went on the Andrew Marr show and insisted Scotland Yard was taking the claims seriously and promised there would be no cover-up . 'There are a series of claims over a relatively long period of time and not all of them are linked \u2013 although in the public\u2019s imagination they may be. \u2018We have now had more recently this discussion or these claims about murder and, of course, that makes it even more serious.\u2019 Among the latest allegations are that police may have helped cover up the murder of an eight-year-old boy. It is claimed he was one of three killed by the network alleged to include former MPs and cabinet ministers. Detectives are searching through files on at least 200 missing children to try to identify the alleged victims. A man who claims to have been sexually abused by the group has told police he saw a then-serving Conservative MP murder a boy during a sexual assault in London in around 1980. He said he witnessed the murder of another boy in front of a former Conservative cabinet minister around one or two years later. He also alleged that a third boy had been killed. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured left) agreed the claims are likely to be the tip of the iceberg while Labour MP John Mann (right) said it would be 'extraordinary' if there are not arrests of prominent people . The Government is still seeking a chairman for its wide-ranging inquiry into the handling of paedophile activity by members of the Establishment after two candidates quit over their links to senior figures from the period. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said yesterday: \u2018The latest revelations on historical child abuse are alarming. \u2018And the Home Secretary is right that this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. \u2018It is important the inquiry gets under way and that action is taken swiftly to make the system better now so we can protect our children and take what they say about anyone seriously.\u2019 She spoke as it emerged that Labour figures were passed warnings about the Elm Guest House, which was allegedly used by the paedophiles. A union official wrote to David Blunkett and John Prescott, the then home secretary and deputy prime minister, to warn that it was being used as a brothel. Mr Blunkett, who replied personally in November 2002 and alerted Home Office staff, yesterday said the tip-off did not include claims of child sex abuse.",

The Asian name is the most common surname of doctors registered in Britain, according to figures. Patel \u2013 from the Gujarat region of India \u2013 was the second most popular, and Muslim surnames Ahmed and Ali also made the top ten list. Smith and Jones featured on the list as the most common names of British origin. The rest of the list was made up by Williams, Davies, Thomas and Taylor. But the list does not indicate where the doctor was born or trained. While many will have come from abroad, a high proportion of those with Asian surnames are likely to be the British-born children of immigrants. The most common first names for male doctors are David, John and Andrew, while for women they are Sarah, Elizabeth and Helen. There are nearly 270,000 doctors registered with the General Medical Council regulator. Its figures show more than one third gained their primary qualification outside the UK, with the biggest numbers from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Nearly 35,000 were trained in India and Pakistan. Since February 2012 there has been an 11 per cent increase in Pakistani-trained doctors registered in Britain, while numbers of Nigerian-qualified doctors have risen 8 per cent. There has been a 20 per cent increase in Bulgarian-trained doctors, and a 17 per cent rise in Romanian-trained doctors. But overall the proportion of foreign-trained doctors in Britain has fallen slightly by 1 per cent over 18 months. Britain saw an influx of Asian doctors in the 1960s and 1970s when the government invited medics from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to solve an NHS staffing crisis. Since then many have come from other countries, particularly after Labour increased NHS funding from 1997. Khan - which means ruler or leader - is a surname with Mongolian-Turkic roots which is now mainly found in Islamic communities in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is common among the Pashtuns of South-Central Asia, but is also used by Bengalis, Mughals and Muslim Rajputs. According to the British Surnames database, Khan is the 24th most common surname in the United Kingdom. In Iran and parts of the Indian subcontinent it is used as an honorific title after a person\u2019s name. Patel - which means inn keeper - is a surname of northern Indian origin mainly used by Hindu groups whose ancestors belonged to the Landlords community. The name Patel is found primarily in the Indian state of Gujarat, but is also found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Delhi. According to the British Surnames database, it is the eighth most common surname within the UK. It is the third most common in the Greater London region. But in recent years there have been concerns some may have poor language skills and less thorough training. Foreign-trained doctors are also more likely to be struck off than British doctors. Last year 75 per cent of those struck off had been trained overseas. Doctors from abroad must pass an English language test and the GMC\u2019s Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test, designed to ensure they have the same level of medical knowledge as UK graduates who have completed their first foundation training year. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: \u2018Doctors from all over the world have long come to work in this country and have in many areas kept the NHS going. We owe them a great deal. Our job is to make sure those who gain entry have the knowledge and skills to practise safely here.\u2019",

On his way? Southampton's Adam Lallana could be set for a summer move to Liverpool . Southampton continue to insist their star players are going nowhere but should be braced for offers as soon as the season finishes next month.

He can expect to double his \u00a335,000-a-week earnings. Roy Hodgson will name the 25-year-old in his England World Cup squad despite nagging concerns over a groin injury, which might have kept him out of the final two Barclays Premier League matches.

A climber died after he fell more than 100ft down an icy mountain in Snowdonia earlier today. The unnamed man was 2,500ft high on Glyder Fawr above the Ogwen Valley when he lost his footing on the frozen slopes. An RAF Sea King helicopter was called to the scene but despite the crew\u2019s attempt to revive the man he was pronounced dead upon arrival in hospital. Danger: Conditions in Snowdonia, pictured this week, has been described as 'treacherous' by local rescue teams after the fourth incident this week saw one man die in a fall . The helicopter was sent from RAF Valley in Anglesey where Prince William is based, but it has not been confirmed whether William, or Flight Lieutenant Wales as the Prince is known the base, was involved in the rescue mission. Shortly afterwards the team were called to nearby Carnedd Dafydd where a hiking couple found they were unable to continue their holiday walk due the snow conditions. The Sea King helicopter arrived to aid the couple, who were located on a walking route 2,000ft up in the mountains. The crew initially struggled to locate the pair, but were eventually able to connect with their mobile phone line. The man and woman, in their late 20s, were winched into the Sea King then flown to the mountain rescue base in the Ogwen Valley. Accident: The crew on the RAF Sea King helicopter dispatched from Anglesey tried to revive the man, but he was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital .

                "Denser_Summary": "The article discusses a rather unfortunate incident in which a climber, who unfortunately has not been named, departed life after slipping down an icy mountain reaching over 100 feet in Snowdonia. Specifically, he was 2,500ft high on Glyder Fawr, above the Ogwen Valley, when he lost his footing which we believe was due to the frozen conditions of the terrain. An RAF Sea King helicopter was promptly dispatched to assist, but despite the efforts of the crew, the man sadly did not make it and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. The article continues to elaborate upon these hazardous conditions in Snowdonia, as well as on similar instances of danger and calamity that have been witnessed in the recent past."
